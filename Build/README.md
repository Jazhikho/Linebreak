## Build

- `Scripts`: PowerShell or Bash scripts that wrap `dotnet publish` for target platforms.
- `Pipelines`: CI configuration files for automated builds and packaging.
- `Artifacts`: Generated installers or archives (ignored by git via `.gitignore`).

Refer to `Docs/ProjectRules.md` for packaging conventions and versioning strategy.
